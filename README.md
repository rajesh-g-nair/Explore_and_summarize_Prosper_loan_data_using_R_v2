Exploratory Data Analysis of the Prosper Loan Data Using R (Udacity Project)

This is the second Revision

This work has been done as a part of Udacity Project for Exploratory Data Analysis

The Prosper Loan data has been explored using R to identify and find insights and patterns in the data

Prosper is a unique concept of peer-to-peer lending where the Lenders and Borrowers are enrolled members.

The Borrowers list loan requests and Lenders invest in these listings requested by borrowers. Multiple Lenders can invest in a single listing. The Borrowers have Credit Grades associated with them which are AA, A, B, C, D, E and HR with AA being the best and HR being the worst. This gives Lenders an idea of the risk proportion of their investment.

The following fields names were replaced by removing the spaces and Brackets with Underscore for easy reference of these fields in the R

Original field names: ProsperRating (numeric), ProsperRating (Alpha), ListingCategory (numeric), TradesNeverDelinquent (percentage)

Updated field names: ProsperRating_numeric, ProsperRating_Alpha, ListingCategory_numeric, TradesNeverDelinquent_percentage
